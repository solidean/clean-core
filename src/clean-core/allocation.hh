// cc::allocation<T> is the owning “storage + liveness” handle underlying all contiguous heap containers.
//
// It models two things explicitly:
// 1) which bytes are owned (the allocation from a cc::memory_resource),
// 2) which objects inside those bytes are currently alive (the live window).
//
// Containers such as cc::array<T>, cc::vector<T>, and cc::devector<T> differ mainly in *policy*
// (how obj_start / obj_end move and when growth happens). The sharp, failure-prone mechanics—
// allocation ownership, resizing, alignment, and object lifetime—are centralized here.
//
// Memory is obtained from a polymorphic cc::memory_resource (POD, function-pointer based, static-init safe).
// The resource pointer is stored *in the allocation*, not as a template argument. A null resource
// means “use cc::default_memory_resource”. This avoids allocator-typed container variants, ABI bloat,
// and allocator-propagation complexity endemic to std-style allocator templates.
//
// Usage is simple by default: do nothing and the global default resource is used.
// Custom allocators are immediately supported: seed an empty allocation with a non-null resource,
// adopt an allocation from elsewhere, or reallocate across resources explicitly.
//
// Core invariants:
// - [alloc_start, alloc_end) is the owned byte range (exclusive end).
// - [obj_start, obj_end) is the live object range (exclusive end), always within the allocation.
// - obj_start and obj_end are always aligned to alignof(T), even when empty.
// - custom_resource == nullptr implies use of cc::default_memory_resource.
//
// Member layout (storage + metadata):
// - T* obj_start                         — pointer to the first live object
// - T* obj_end                           — one past the last live object
// - cc::byte* alloc_start                — base pointer returned by the memory resource
// - cc::byte* alloc_end                  — one past the last allocated byte
// - isize alignment                      — alignment used for allocate/deallocate of the byte block
// - cc::memory_resource const* custom_resource — owning resource, or nullptr for the global default

/// Owning allocation handle for a contiguous byte block plus a typed "live window" inside it.

/// Design goals:
/// - Separate "what memory do we own?" from "which objects are currently alive in it?".
/// - Support pooling / reuse without reallocating by keeping the underlying byte allocation intact.
/// - Enable zero-copy interop between contiguous owning containers (adopt/release), and safe fallible
///   re-interpretation (retype) for trivially copyable payloads when the live window is cleared.
///
/// This is intentionally more expressive than the classic (ptr, size, capacity) triple:
/// - We keep the original allocation bounds (alloc_start/alloc_end) so we can round-trip capacity
///   across retypes and support realignment by moving obj_start/obj_end within the allocation.
/// - We treat capacity as an implicit property derived from the remaining bytes between obj_end and
///   alloc_end (and, for front-growth containers, between alloc_start and obj_start).
///
/// Philosophy:
/// - All owning containers that store their elements contiguously should be built on cc::allocation<T>.
///   This includes the main containers: array<T>, vector<T>, and devector<T> (double-ended vector).
/// - Sharing this handle gives those containers a uniform "escape hatch" story: allocations can be
///   adopted, released, retyped, and transferred across container types without copying.
/// - Non-owning views (span<T> / fixed_span<T, N>) are the common interop surface: contiguous containers
///   can usually expose span<T> views of their live window.
///
/// Fixed-size container variants:
/// - fixed_* containers carry their extent/capacity as template argument N and store data inline.
/// - They reuse the same object-lifetime helpers (construct/destroy/commit patterns) but do not use
///   cc::allocation<T> since there is no heap allocation to adopt/release; copying/moving is explicit.
/// - fixed_array<T, N> is fully alive and can provide fixed_span<T, N> in addition to span<T>.
///   fixed_vector<T, N> and fixed_devector<T, N> track partial liveness but still remain inline.
///
/// Tradeoffs:
/// - This handle is larger than a minimal vector header, but it centralizes allocation metadata that
///   we need for robust pooling/reuse, deallocation correctness, and strong container interop.
/// - Ring buffers with wrap-around are intentionally not represented here: once data wraps, the live
///   region becomes segmented and no longer matches contiguous container semantics.
/// - Alignment above alignof(T) is supported by moving the live window within the byte allocation
///   (usually after clear), rather than by infecting container types with alignment template args.
///
/// Invariants (unless stated otherwise by a specific container):
/// - [obj_start, obj_end) is the live object range; obj_end is exclusive.
/// - size() is (obj_end - obj_start) in elements.
/// - [alloc_start, alloc_end) is the owned byte allocation; alloc_end is exclusive.
/// - alloc_start <= obj_start <= obj_end <= alloc_end (even for empty ranges or empty allocations).
/// - obj_start and obj_end must be aligned to alignof(T) (even when the range is empty).
/// - resource == nullptr means the global default memory resource is used.
